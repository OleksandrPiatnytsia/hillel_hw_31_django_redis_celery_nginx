"""The cached /api/authors/ and /api/categories/ (api.cache) are dropped
on every change that can change them: names, bios, slugs and books_count
(a book created, deleted, moved to another author or category).

Coarse on purpose: any change of these models starts a new generation.
They change rarely (a few edits a day), and a finer rule ("did the
count of this author change?") would be easy to get wrong.
