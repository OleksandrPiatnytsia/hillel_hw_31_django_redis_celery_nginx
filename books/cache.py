"""Cache of the book data (Redis; LocMemCache in the tests).

Two kinds of cache, both WITHOUT the stock (it changes with every order
and is read fresh every time, see BookQuerySet.with_stock()):

1. Low-level cache: the Book object of the book page, with its author and
   categories, under the key "books:book:<pk>".
       get_cached_book(7) -> from Redis, or 2 queries + cache.set()

2. Template fragments ({% cache %} in book_list.html / book_detail.html):
   ready HTML of the parts of a book that are the same for every visitor.
   One fragment per book per language: the texts around the data
   ("Cover of ...", "Added ...") are translated.

Both are deleted by books.signals when a book, its author, a category or
the link book <-> category changes (invalidate_books()). The timeout is
only a safety net for a change that skips the signals (QuerySet.update()).

Logs (logger "books.cache", see LOGGING in settings):
    DEBUG  Book cache hit: id=7 / Book cache miss: id=7, cached for 3600 s
    INFO   Book cache cleared: ids=[7] (7 keys), reason: Book saved
DEBUG is shown only with DEBUG=True (APP_LOG_LEVEL). The hits of the
{% cache %} fragments are not logged: the template tag has no hook for it;
the fragments of a book are deleted together with its object (the same
"cleared" line, "7 keys" = 1 object + 3 fragments x 2 languages).
