"""Cache invalidation: every change of the book data deletes its cache.

What is cached (books.cache): the Book object of the book page and the
HTML fragments of the catalog card and the book page. They contain the
book itself, its author's name and its categories, so all of these
changes must delete them:

    Book saved / deleted                -> that book
    Author saved (name)                 -> all books of the author
    Category saved / deleted (name)     -> all books of the category
    Book <-> Category link changed      -> that book (or the books of
      (form, admin inline, .add())         the category, from its side)

The stock is NOT cached, so orders don't touch the cache at all.

Not covered: QuerySet.update() and raw SQL send no signals. The cache
timeout (BOOK_CACHE_TIMEOUT) is the safety net for them.
